"The National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors (NASTAD) has also remained in contact with the major manufacturers of HIV medicine, as many of these products rely on ingredients produced in other countries."
"Currently, treatment for COVID-19 is very limited. There is no evidence that any medicines used to treat HIV are effective against COVID-19. People with HIV should not switch their HIV medicine in an attempt to prevent or treat COVID-19."
"It’s important to continue taking your HIV medicine as prescribed. This will help keep your immune system healthy."
"*Talk to your health care provider and make sure all your vaccinations are up to date, including vaccinations against seasonal influenza (flu) and bacterial pneumonia. These vaccine-preventable diseases disproportionally affect people with HIV."
"*Establish and maintain a plan for remote clinical care. Try to establish a telemedicine link through your HIV care provider’s online portal. If telemedicine is not available to you, make sure you can communicate with your provider by phone or text."
"Drug shortages or anticipated problems with HIV medicine have not been identified."
"Are people with HIV at higher risk for COVID-19 than other people?"
"If you have HIV and are taking your HIV medicine, it is important to continue your treatment and follow the advice of your health care provider. This is the best way to keep your immune system healthy."
"Are shortages of HIV medicine (ART) or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) expected?"
"People with HIV should take everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of COVID-19."
"People with HIV should also continue to maintain a healthy lifestyle by:
*Eating right,
*Getting at least 8 hours of sleep per night, and
*Reducing stress as much as possible.
Staying healthy helps your immune system fight off infection should it occur."
"Nearly half of people in the United States with diagnosed HIV are aged 50 years and older. People with HIV also have higher rates of certain underlying health conditions."
"What can people with HIV do to protect themselves from COVID-19?"
"We are still learning about COVID-19 and how it affects people with HIV. Based on limited data, we believe people with HIV who are on effective HIV treatment have the same risk for COVID-19 as people who do not have HIV."
"*People with HIV can sometimes be more likely than others to need extra help from friends, family, neighbors, community health workers, and others. If you become sick, make sure you stay in touch by phone or email with people who can help you."
"Some clinical trials are looking at whether HIV medicines can treat COVID-19. Other trials are looking at the effectiveness of different drugs to treat COVID-19 in people with HIV. They are also looking to better understand how people with HIV manage COVID-19."
"People aged 16 through 64 with underlying medical conditions, including people who are in an immunocompromised state from HIV, might be at increased risk for severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19 and may be considered for vaccination in phase 1c."
"People with HIV are part of the group of people with underlying medical conditions. If you have HIV, you may choose to get vaccinated if you have not had a severe or immediate allergic reaction to any of the vaccine ingredients."
"You can update your remote clinical care plan every year, or any time you have a change in your health or HIV treatment."
"*If your health care provider changed your HIV treatment, ask if it’s safe to delay the change until follow-up testing and monitoring are possible."
"People with a low CD4 cell count and
People not on effective HIV treatment (antiretroviral therapy or ART)."
"*If your HIV is undetectable (or virally suppressed), talk to your health care provider about delaying your routine medical and lab visits."
"Can HIV medicine (ART) be used to treat COVID-19?"
"Make sure you have at least a 30- to 90-day supply of your HIV medicine and any other medications or medical supplies you need for managing HIV. Ask your health care provider about receiving your medicine by mail"
